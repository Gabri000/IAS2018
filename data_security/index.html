    <h1>Disk encryption</h1>
    <p>Disk encryption refers to encryption technology that encrypts data on a hard disk drive. Disk encryption typically
     takes form in either software (see disk encryption software) or hardware (see disk encryption hardware). Disk encryption
     is often referred to as on-the-fly encryption (OTFE) or transparent encryption.</p>
     <h1>Software versus hardware-based mechanisms for protecting data</h1>
     <p>Software-based security solutions encrypt the data to protect it from theft. However, a malicious program or a hacker
       could corrupt the data in order to make it unrecoverable, making the system unusable. Hardware-based security solutions
       can prevent read and write access to data and hence offer very strong protection against tampering and unauthorized access.

     Hardware based security or assisted computer security offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Security tokens
     such as those using PKCS#11 may be more secure due to the physical access required in order to be compromised. Access is enabled
      only when the token is connected and correct PIN is entered (see two-factor authentication). However, dongles can be used by
      anyone who can gain physical access to it. Newer technologies in hardware-based security solves this problem offering full proof
       security for data.

      Working of hardware-based security: A hardware device allows a user to log in, log out and set different privilege levels by
      doing manual actions. The device uses biometric technology to prevent malicious users from logging in, logging out, and changing
      privilege levels. The current state of a user of the device is read by controllers in peripheral devices such as hard disks.
      Illegal access by a malicious user or a malicious program is interrupted based on the current state of a user by hard disk and
      DVD controllers making illegal access to data impossible. Hardware-based access control is more secure than protection provided
      by the operating systems as operating systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks by viruses and hackers. The data on hard disks
       can be corrupted after a malicious access is obtained. With hardware-based protection, software cannot manipulate the user privilege
        levels. It is impossible for a hacker or a malicious program to gain access to secure data protected by hardware or perform
        unauthorized privileged operations. This assumption is broken only if the hardware itself is malicious or contains a backdoor.
        The hardware protects the operating system image and file system privileges from being tampered. Therefore, a completely secure
         system can be created using a combination of hardware-based security and secure system administration policies.</p>
