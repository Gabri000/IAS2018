    <h1>IT and Society</h1>

    <p>This is the main page of the IT and Society project.
      The links above take you to specific topics.</p>

    <p>Done by EEB2 students of ICT (S4) in 2018 with some
       guidance provided by teacher Mr. Kerkk√§nen.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Some learning targets of the project:</p>
    <p>Version management (Git & GitHub with Atom)</p>
    <p>Project management and collaboration</p>
    <p>HTML and CSS</p>
    <p>About the topics</p>

    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ul>
    - <li>Every team creates a topic-specific folder to manage the files related to the topic.</li>
    - <li>Create an `index.html` file in your folder. This is the main page of your topic.</li>
    - Every team creates a CSS file to change the look of the topic pages. Name it `styles_X.css` where X is replaced by your topic name (or its shorthand expression). Save the CSS file in the `styles` folder and add links to your pages to make it work.
    - Present your topic in a simple and understandable way. Divide it into logical parts and make the site structure accordingly.
    - Write your own text. Don't copy-and-paste text without a good reason - and in that case mark the source immediately. *Note: if you don't understand a word or an expression, don't use it! Write the idea in other words or leave it out.*
    - Linking: you must be able to easily navigate between the pages in your topic folder. Preserve the link to the home of homes, too.
    - Sources: make a separate HTML page to list the sources (give the links, too).
    - Copyright: make sure you are allowed to use the images and other materials and follow the given source marking recommendations.
    </ul>
