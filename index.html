    <p>This is the main page of the IT and Society project.
      The links above take you to specific topics.</p>

    <p>Done by EEB2 students of ICT (S4) in 2018 with some
       guidance provided by teacher Mr. Kerkk&auml;nen.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Some learning targets of the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Version management (Git & GitHub with Atom)</li>
      <li>Project management and collaboration</li>
      <li>HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Topics</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="info">
      <h2>Requirements:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every team creates a topic-specific folder to manage the files related to the topic.</li>
        <li>Create an `index.html` file in your folder. This is the main page of your topic.</li>
        <li>Every team creates a CSS file to change the look of the topic pages.
          Name it `styles_X.css` where X is replaced by your topic name (or its
          shorthand expression). Save the CSS file in the `styles` folder and add
          links to your pages to make it work.</li>
        <li>Present your topic in a simple and understandable way. Divide it into
          logical parts and make the site structure accordingly.</li>
        <li>Write your own text. Don't copy-and-paste text without a good reason -
          and in that case mark the source immediately. *Note: if you don't understand
          a word or an expression, don't use it! Write the idea in other words or
          leave it out.*</li>
        <li>Linking: you must be able to easily navigate between the pages in your
          topic folder. Preserve the link to the home of homes, too.</li>
        <li>Sources: make a separate HTML page to list the sources (give the links, too).</li>
        <li>Copyright: make sure you are allowed to use the images and other materials
          and follow the given source marking recommendations.</li>
      </ul>
