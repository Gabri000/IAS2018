						<div class="content">
							<p>For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required.
An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.</p>

							<p>Symmetric key -
In symmetric-key schemes, the encryption and decryption keys are the same. Communicating parties must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication.</p>

							<p>Public key -
In public-key encryption schemes, the encryption key is published for anyone to use and encrypt messages. However, only the receiving party has access to the decryption key that enables messages to be read. Public-key encryption was first described in a secret document in 1973 before then all encryption schemes were symmetric-key (also called private-key).</p>
