							<p>Based on the evidence that we do have, the first instance of encryption and the science of cryptography dates back to ancient Egypt. Modifications of their hieroglyphic alphabet was found in several tombs and ancient remains dating back to 1900 BCE, with their objectives ranging from secrecy to dignified epitaphs to even plain amusement for the literate population. In fact, most intelligent civilisations did use some form of encryption and ciphers in their literature and military communication. Arthashastra, an ancient treatise on statecraft written and modified by Chanakya between 2nd Century BCE and 3rd Century CE, mentions the usage of secret writing in Indian espionage.
							   One of the most commonly cited historical examples of cryptography and ciphers is the Caesar cipher, which is also reportedly the first popular military cipher. This simple substitution cipher, where each letter was replaced by the letter which was 3 places after it on the alphabet, was used by Julius Caesar around 100 BCE to communicate with his generals on the warfront. It is easy to see that this type of cipher is highly susceptible to breaking. In fact, even if you consider that the letters could be substituted by another letter which could be any distance further from 1 to 26, all it would take is 26 people trying the possibilities till at least a single word makes sense. But this was still quite secure at that time because most of Caesars enemies were illiterate or assumed it to be some strange foreign language.
Enigma is a name that has been the source of bafflement for almost an entire generation of cryptanalysts. In 1918, German inventor Arthur Scherbius, bothered by the consistent failures of his countrys encryption systems, designed a mechanised version of Albertis cipher disc, which in turn was a mechanization of the Vigenere Cipher. Called Enigma, this would go on to become the most feared encryption system in history. The original construction consisted of mainly three components - A keyboard for entering plaintext letters; A keyboard for entering plaintext letters; A scrambling unit for encrypting each plaintext letter; A display board to indicate corresponding ciphertext letter</p>
