    <p class="QUOTE"><br>AI began with "an ancient wish to forge the gods." - Pamela McCorduck</p>
    <p class="NORMALTEXT">AI is a concept and it is hard to determine who first thought of it.
    But if someone asked, the least wrong answer would be that it came from Greek mythology.
    <br>In Greek myths it's possible to find stories about intelligent artefacts such as the Greek myths of: Hephaestus, the blacksmith who manufactured mechanical servants, and Talos the bronze man.
    <br>Apart from that, AI was present in history on many other occasions:</p>

    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Aristotle invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism">syllogistic</a> logic, the first formal deductive reasoning system.</li>

     <p class="NORMALTEXT">13th century</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Talking heads were said to have been created, Roger Bacon and Albert the Great reputedly among the owners.</li>
      <li>Ramon Lull, Spanish theologian, invented machines for discovering nonmathematical truths through combinatorics.</li>
      <li>In 1206 A.D., Al-Jazari, an Arab inventor, designed what is believed to be the first programmable humanoid robot, a boat carrying four mechanical musicians powered by water flow.</li>

     <p class="NORMALTEXT">15th-16th century</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Clocks, the first modern measuring machines, were first produced using lathes.</li>

     <p class="NORMALTEXT">16th century</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Clockmakers extended their craft to creating mechanical animals and other novelties. For example, see DaVinci's walking lion (1515).</li>
      <li>Rabbi Loew of Prague is said to have invented the Golem, a clay man brought to life (1580).</li>

 <p class="NORMALTEXT">17th century</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Early in the century, Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines. Many other 17th century thinkers offered variations and elaborations of Cartesian mechanism.</li>
      <li>Thomas Hobbes published The Leviathan (1651), containing a mechanistic and combinatorial theory of thinking.</li>
      <li>Arithmetical machines devised by Sir Samuel Morland between 1662 and 1666Leibniz improved Pascal's machine to do multiplication & division with a machine called the Step Reckoner (1673) and envisioned a universal calculus of reasoning by which arguments could be decided mechanically.</li>
    </ul>
    
     <p class="NORMALTEXT">18th century</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>The 18th century saw a profusion of mechanical toys, including the celebrated mechanical duck of Vaucanson and von Kempelen's phony mechanical chess player, The Turk (1769). Edgar Allen Poe wrote (in the Southern Literary Messenger, April 1836) that the Turk could not be a machine because, if it were, it would not lose.</li>

     <p class="NORMALTEXT">19th century</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented the Jacquard loom, the first programmable machine, with instructions on punched cards (1801).</li>
      <li>Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein's monster (1818). The book Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus available from Project Gutenberg.</li>
      <li>Charles Babbage & Ada Byron (Lady Lovelace) designed a programmable mechanical calculating machines, the Analytical Engine (1832). A working model was built in 2002; a short video shows it working.</li>
      <li>George Boole developed a binary algebra representing (some) "laws of thought," published in The Laws of Thought (1854).</li>
      <li>Modern propositional logic developed by Gottlob Frege in his 1879 work Begriffsschrift and later clarified and expanded by Russell,Tarski, Godel, Church and others.</li>

     <p class="NORMALTEXT">20th century - First Half</p>
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published Principia Mathematica, which revolutionaized formal logic. Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Rudolf Carnap lead philosophy into logical analysis of knowledge.</li>
      <li>Torres y Quevedo built his chess machine 'Ajedrecista', using electromagnets under the board to play the endgame rook and king against the lone king, possibly the first computer game (1912).</li>
      <li>Karel Capek's play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots) produced in 1921 (London opening, 1923). - First use of the word 'robot' in English.</li>

      <li>Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943), laying foundations for neural networks.</li>
      <li>Emil Post proves that production systems are a general computational mechanism (1943). See Ch.2 of Rule Based Expert Systems for the uses of production systems in AI. Post also did important work on completeness, inconsistency, and proof theory.</li>
      <li>Vannevar Bush published As We May Think (Atlantic Monthly, July 1945) a prescient vision of the future in which computers assist humans in many activities.</li>
      <li>Grey Walter experimented with autonomous robots, turtles named Elsie and Elmer, at Bristol (1948-49) based on the premise that a small number of brain cells could give rise to complex behaviors.</li>
      <li>A.M. Turing published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950). - Introduction of Turing Test as a way of operationalizing a test of intelligent behavior. See The Turing Institute for more on Turing.</li>
