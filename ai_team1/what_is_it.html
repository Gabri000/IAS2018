    <h2 class="QUOTE">"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human." - Alan Turing.</h2>
    <p class="NORMALTEXT">Artificial intelligence or machine intelligence (AI or MI) is intelligence shown by machines, opposed to the natural intelligence (NI) of humans and animals.It's an area of computer science that works  on the creation of intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.</p>
    <p class="NORMALTEXT"><br>In AI, the core parts are:
    <ul class="NORMALTEXT">
      <li>Knowledge engineering-To react in ways that are similar to humans, machines need a lot of information. They need to have access to objects and observe various real life situations to initiate common sense, reasoning and problem-solving.</li>
      <li>Machine learning-A machine needs to learn in order do develop, and there are two ways of doing so. Learning without supervision which means the machine needs to identify patterns of inputs. Or learning with supervision. This process involves classification, knowing in which category an objet belongs, and regressions, "obtaining a set of numerical input or output examples, thereby discovering functions enabling the generation of suitable outputs from respective inputs"</li>

    <p class="NORMALTEXT">Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:</p>

      <li>Speech recognition</li>
      <li>Learning</li>
      <li>Planning</li>
