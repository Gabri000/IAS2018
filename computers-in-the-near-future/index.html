    <p>Today computers are in virtually everything we touch, all day long. We still have an
image of computers as being rectangular objects either on a desk, or these days in
our pockets; but computers are in our cars, they’re in our thermostats, they’re in our
refrigerators. In fact, increasingly computers are no longer objects at all, but they
suffuse fabric and virtually every other material. Because of that, we really do need
to care about what the future of computing holds because it is going to impact our
lives all day long.
If you think about the future of computing as a convergence of the biological, the
physical and the digital (and the post-digital quantum), using as examples 3D-
printing, biotechnology, robotics for prosthetics, the internet of things, autonomous
vehicles, other kinds of artificial intelligence, you can see the extent of how life will
change. We need to make sure that these developments benefit all of society, not
just the most wealthy members of society who might want these prosthetics, but
every person who needs them.
One of our first questions in the Council is going to be, how do we establish
governance for equitable innovation? How do we foster the equitable benefits of
these technologies for every nation and every person in every nation? And, is top-
down governance the right model for controlling the use of these technologies, or is
bottom-up ethical education of those that engage in the development of the
technologies and their distribution, a better way to think about how to ensure
equitable use?
I believe that all technologists need to keep in mind a multi-level, multi-part model of
technology that takes into account the technological but also the social, the cultural,
the legal, all of these aspects of development. All technologists need to be trained in
the human as well as the technological so that they understand uses to which their
technology could be put and reflect on the uses they want it to be put to.</p>
    <h1>What will computing look like in 2030?</h1>
    <p>We have no idea yet because change is happening so quickly. We know that
quantum computing – the introduction of physics into the field of computer science –
is going to be extremely important; that computers are going to become really, very
tiny, the size of an atom. That’s going to make a huge difference; nano-computing,
very small computers that you might swallow inside a pill and that will then learn
about your illness and set about curing it; that brings together biological computing
as well, where we can print parts of the body. So I think we’re going to see the
increasing infusing of computing into all aspects of our lives. If our Council has its
way, we’re going to see an increasing sense of responsibility on the part of
technologists to ensure that those developments are for good.</p>
