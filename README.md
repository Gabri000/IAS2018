## IAS2018
A web site presenting topics related to IT and Society, done by S4 ICT students of EEB2 in school year 2017-2018.

#### To show the site in a browser:
https://eeb2.github.io/IAS2018

## Requirements:
- Every team creates a topic-specific folder to manage the files related to the topic.
- Create an `index.html` file in your folder. This is the main page of your topic.
- Every team creates a CSS file to change the look of the topic pages. Name it `styles_X.css` where X is replaced by your topic name (or its shorthand expression). Save the CSS file in the `styles` folder and add links to your pages to make it work.
- Present your topic in a simple and understandable way. Divide it into logical parts and make the site structure accordingly.
- Write your own text. Don't copy-and-paste text without a good reason - and in that case mark the source immediately. *Note: if you don't understand a word or an expression, don't use it! Write the idea in other words or leave it out.*
- Linking: you must be able to easily navigate between the pages in your topic folder. Preserve the link to the home of homes, too.
- Sources: make a separate HTML page to list the sources (give the links, too).
- Copyright: make sure you are allowed to use the images and other materials and follow the given source marking recommendations.

## Help for using ATOM and GITHUB (newer and easier procedure!):
- Create an account on Github.
- Find a repository to clone or create a new one.
- Download and install Atom editor from https://atom.io/. 
- Download GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) to your computer and install it (no admin rights needed)
- Open GitHub Desktop, sign in and Clone the right repository. From now on, you can do most of the basic things in Atom and GitHub Desktop is not needed anymore (Quit).
- Open Folder in Atom and choose the folder containing the cloned repository. And there you are! The work flow goes like this:
#### 1) Pull (to get newest online version) 2) Edit and test 2) Stage and Commit 3) Push (asks for your GitHub username & password)
