    <p>The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) as a teaching aid.

Science-fiction author Isaac Asimov is often given credit for being the first person to use the term robotics in a short story composed in the 1940s. In the story, Asimov suggested three principles to guide the behavior of robots and smart machines. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, as they are called, have survived to the present: 1. Robots must never harm human beings. 2. Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1. 3. Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Some learning targets of the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Version management (Git & GitHub with Atom)</li>
      <li>Project management and collaboration</li>
      <li>HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Topics</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="info">
      <h2>Requirements:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every team creates a topic-specific folder to manage the files related to the topic.</li>
        <li>Create an `index.html` file in your folder. This is the main page of your topic.</li>
        <li>Every team creates a CSS file to change the look of the topic pages.
          Name it `styles_X.css` where X is replaced by your topic name (or its
          shorthand expression). Save the CSS file in the `styles` folder and add
          links to your pages to make it work.</li>
        <li>Present your topic in a simple and understandable way. Divide it into
          logical parts and make the site structure accordingly.</li>
        <li>Write your own text. Don't copy-and-paste text without a good reason -
          and in that case mark the source immediately. *Note: if you don't understand
          a word or an expression, don't use it! Write the idea in other words or
          leave it out.*</li>
        <li>Linking: you must be able to easily navigate between the pages in your
          topic folder. Preserve the link to the home of homes, too.</li>
        <li>Sources: make a separate HTML page to list the sources (give the links, too).</li>
        <li>Copyright: make sure you are allowed to use the images and other materials
          and follow the given source marking recommendations.</li>
      </ul>
